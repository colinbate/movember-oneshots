## Movember 2025

Welcome to this year’s charity one-shot adventure!

For 2025 we’ll be diving into **Troika!**, the rules-light science-fantasy RPG of strange spheres and surreal adventures. *Warning, things will get weird.*

**As always, the cost to play is a donation to my Movember campaign. Any amount is fine. You can donate on the [official event donation page](/donate).**

- **Any gender/experience level welcome**
- Games are not streamed/recorded
- Audio required, video optional
- Computer with a modern browser required  
(we will be using Foundry VTT)
- Looking for ~3-4 players per session
- I will be using some AI generated visuals

## Teaser

Once every year, the Mirror Moon rises to bless the citizens of this sphere with various adornments, like radiant moustaches and beards. But this year, the reflection failed to appear. Instead, moustaches across the land have *walked off their faces*, banding together to form the Great Whisker Union.

Without them, people are losing not just their facial hair, but their very sense of identity. You and your companions have been chosen to represent the Bedazzled Collective, and voyage to the old abandoned Monastery of the Mirror Moon and parley with—or battle—the shadowy union boss.

Can you make everyone fabulous again? Or will you shuffle off into obscurity.

## Preparation

No prep needed. I will have some custom moustache-themed backgrounds to use, like the Waxemancer and the Barber; and Foundry can auto-roll your character. The style is light and gonzo.

If you do want to dig into the Troika! system, here is an intro video.

If you haven't played in one of my games before, you can read [my code of ethics/conduct](https://divora.world/code-of-ethics/) which applies to all the games I run.

Reach out to me it there are any topics or subject matter I should avoid.

## Dates and Times

By default, the games will run Saturday evenings (GMT-3/4). Times are pretty flexible, so let me know if you prefer a different day or time. I am planning to do at least one game during the week, rather than the weekend. Let me know if you have a preference.  

Sessions are ~3 hours. Each session runs the same adventure, so you only need to join one.

If you don’t have a way to contact me otherwise, I’m on Discord as `colinbate`.
