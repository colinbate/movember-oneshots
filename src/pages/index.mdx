# It's that time again!

## Movember 2022

Colin here, and as in years past, I'm planning to run a series of charity D&D one-shot sessions to support men's health.

This year the adventure is called **Swamp of Despair**. Despite the name, I try to run fun games with humour mixed in. That said there will be touches of men's health themes present in case that is an issue.

**The cost to play is a donation to my Movember campaign. Any amount is fine. Payment instructions will follow.**

Come hang out for a few hours and roll some dice for charity. This is a recurring event throughout the month. I will be hosting 3-4 of the one-shot sessions during Movember. Each session will be the same adventure, so you only need to join one. Most games will be Saturday evening Atlantic time, but there might be a Sunday evening game if the demand is there. Games will be around 4 hours long.

We will be playing D&D 5e on Foundry VTT. Players of any gender can join. **New/beginner players welcome.** Looking for 4-5 players for each game.

We will be using level 6 characters. Any official race and class. You can have a +1 weapon and some other magic item (uncommon). Create characters on [DndBeyond](https://dndbeyond.com), if you need access to content let me know and I'll send you a link to join my Movember campaign. If this is all new to you, don't worry, I can help.

### Dates and Times

Most of the times below are flexible to start anywhere from an hour earlier than listed, or an hour later. They should be displaying in your local timezone.

If you are interested in joining a game, message me and tell me which one. We will be coordinating the game via Discord so if you are not already on my server, I can send you an invitation.

### Game 1

<LocalDate date="2022-11-05T23:00:00Z" />

This is the maiden voyage, so might be a bit rough, also, the most likely to run over time.

### Game 2

<LocalDate date="2022-11-13T00:00:00Z" />
<LocalDate date="2022-11-14T00:00:00Z" />

This one is a bit more flexible, as I am open to the possibility of doing this either Saturday or Sunday evening.

### Game 3

<LocalDate date="2022-11-20T00:00:00Z" />

I'm hoping by this point I have things running like a well oiled machine.

### Game 4

<LocalDate date="2022-11-27T00:00:00Z" />

This is the weekend of American Thanksgiving, and last year I found it tricky to find Americans who wanted to take time out. So for my non-American friends, this is a viable option.
