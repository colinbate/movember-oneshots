# Movember 2024

</nav>

Hello! I am getting started working on the adventure for this year's Movember game.

I have not decided on the game system we will use this year. I recently backed the Nimble 5e rules which are an optimization of 5e, and if I think that fits my style when I read it (soon), then that might be what I use. Otherwise I'll go back to Brighter Worlds maybe.

**As always the cost to play is a donation to my Movember campaign. Any amount is fine. You can donate on the [official event donation page](/donate).**

Come hang out for a few hours and roll some dice for charity. This is a recurring event throughout the month. I will be hosting 3-5 of the one-shot sessions during Movember. Each session will be the same adventure, so you only need to join one. Most games will be Saturday evening Atlantic time, but there might be other times if the demand is there. Games will be around 3-4 hours long.

- You will need a computer with a modern browser and audio capabilities.
- Video will be optional.
- Games are not recorded or streamed.
- Players of any gender can join.
- **New/beginner players welcome.**
- Looking for roughly 3 players for each game.
- I do use some AI generated artwork within the game for scenes and characters.

### Synopsis

Coming soon.

---

### Preparation

No preparation is technically necessary as the first part of the session I will help everyone create or generate characters, as well as explain the basic rules. 

I will post details on where to read rules/watch videos etc., once I have figured that side of things out.

Until then, you can read [my code of ethics/conduct](https://divora.world/code-of-ethics/) which applies to all the games I run.

### Dates and Times

By default, the games happen Saturday evening in my timezone (GMT-3/4). However, in order to accommodate more people I will try to run some alternative times as well. Reach out and let me know.

The times below are a starting guide and should be displayed in your local browser's time zone.
