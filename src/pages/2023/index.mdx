# Movember 2023

</nav>

Colin here, and this year we are going to be playing with fire... in more ways than one.

Things will be a bit different this year in that we won't be playing Dungeons & Dragons. We will be playing a different table-top role playing game system (details <abbr title="To be announced">TBA</abbr>) that will hopefully reflect the fun and whimsical style of game that I'm hoping to run. That said there may be touches of men's health themes present in case that is an issue.

**The cost to play is a donation to my Movember campaign. Any amount is fine. You can donate on the [official event donation page](/donate).**

Come hang out for a few hours and roll some dice for charity. This is a recurring event throughout the month. I will be hosting 3-4 of the one-shot sessions during Movember. Each session will be the same adventure, so you only need to join one. Most games will be Saturday evening Atlantic time, but there might be other times if the demand is there. Games will be around 3-4 hours long.

- You will need a computer with a modern browser and audio capabilities.
- Video will be optional.
- Games are not recorded or streamed.
- Players of any gender can join.
- **New/beginner players welcome.**
- Looking for roughly 3 players for each game.

### Preparation

I'm hoping to avoid the need for people to do any preparation. That said, I will provide some more information later for those people who like to read up ahead of time.

### Dates and Times

By default, the games happen Saturday evening in my timezone (GMT-3). However, in order to accommodate more people I will try to run some alternative times as well. Reach out and let me know.

The times below are a starting guide and should be displayed in your local browser's time zone.
