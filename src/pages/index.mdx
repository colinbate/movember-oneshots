# It's that time again!

## Movember 2022

Colin here, and as in years past, I'm planning to run a series of charity D&D one-shot adventures to support men's health.

Come hang out for a few hours and roll some dice for charity. This is a recurring event throughout the month. I will be hosting 3-4 one-shot sessions during Movember. Each session will be the same adventure, so you only need to join one. Most games will be Saturday evening Atlantic time, but there might be a Sunday evening game if the demand is there. Games will be around 4 hours long.

We will be playing D&D 5e on Foundry VTT. **New players welcome.** Looking for 4-5 players for each game. I will provide details on character creation, but you can create your own or use a pre-made one.

Most of the times below are flexible to start anywhere from an hour earlier than listed, or an hour later. They should be displaying in your local timezone.

### Game 1

<LocalDate date="2022-11-05T23:00:00Z" />

This is the maiden voyage, so might be a bit rough, also, the most likely to run over time.

### Game 2

<LocalDate date="2022-11-13T00:00:00Z" />
<LocalDate date="2022-11-14T00:00:00Z" />

This one is a bit more flexible, as I am open to the possibility of doing this either Saturday or Sunday evening.

### Game 3

<LocalDate date="2022-11-20T00:00:00Z" />

I'm hoping by this point I have things running like a well oiled machine.

### Game 4

<LocalDate date="2022-11-27T00:00:00Z" />

This is the weekend of American Thanksgiving, and last year I found it tricky to find Americans who wanted to take time out. So for my non-American friends, this is a viable option.
